# Thesis
This is the code and data for the thesis

Game files 2.0 - contains the code and data for the LQRE analysis. 
NOTE: Generally only for n=2 is well anotated, the other files are based on n=2 just slightly modified for more players.
  Game Creation -  Creates the games/payoffs for n=2 -> n=6 for the Tullock contest, and Gambit file
  Game Creation Outputs - The outputs from Game Creation (gambit file to be opened with Gambit app)
  Gambit QRE Output - The Results of running the QRE on Gambit app, using the Game Creation Output files
  Analysis of Gambit QRE Output - Calculates the expected individual and aggregate investment for all levels of n. Output is csv file.
  Final csv files for graphing - Is the output from Analysis of Gambit QRE Output.
  Graph and Graph Code - Has the pdf of graphs used in LQRE section of thesis and code to recreate these graphs (The graphs were done using glueviz)
  
Python 2.0 - Contains all the code and data fro the PQRE analysis.
NOTE: Generally only for n=2 is well anotated, the other files are based on n=2 just slightly modified for more players.
  Coding2 - Creates the games and runs the analysis on the games finding the PQRE. Output is csv files
  x players - The csv files for n=2->n=6 from coding2
  pdf files - the graphs 
    Sadly Glueviz whilst making the graphs correctly does not give working code output as the number of columns does not always add up. So no code for graph creation.
