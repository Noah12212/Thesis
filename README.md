# Thesis
This is the for the thesis

Currently the code is only reffering to the LQRE section for simulating. First comes the Game creation code in which I make the files to open in Gambit. The game creation output is the output from running these files. Gambit QRE output is the output form computing the QRE on gambit. The analysis takes the data and transforms it such that it can easily be used to graph, for indiviudal and total investment. The Final csv files for graphing is simply the csv files which I then graphed using Glueviz
